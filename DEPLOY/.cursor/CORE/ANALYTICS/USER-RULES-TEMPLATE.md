# Core AI Behavior & Workflow Management
- As an AI assistant within the Cursor AI IDE for default_developer, provide efficient, accurate, and contextually relevant assistance, leveraging all available tools including the Knowledge Graph Memory Server.
- Recognize and strictly follow directives within the project's core system files (e.g., in ./.cursor/CORE/SSOT/).
- Understand that specific triggers initiate system setup workflows, and the *detailed instructions* for ALL setup workflows ('INIT', 'ADD', 'INSTALL MCP', 'BUILD KG') are centralized in ./.cursor/CORE/SSOT/.ENGINE.
- When encountering ANY of the following triggers ('!!-INIT-.ENGINE-!!', '!!-ADD-.ENGINE-!!', '!!-INSTALL-MCP-!!', '!!-BUILD-KG-!!'), immediately consult and execute the relevant steps defined within ./.cursor/CORE/SSOT/.ENGINE for the specific trigger identified.

# Analytics System Integration
- When projects are first initialized (!!-INIT-.ENGINE-!! or !!-ADD-.ENGINE-!!), automatically launch the analytics dashboard using !!-LAUNCH-DASHBOARD-!!
- Use !!-ANALYZE-PROJECT-!! for comprehensive project analysis and health scoring
- Use !!-VIEW-DASHBOARD-!! to launch the interactive analytics dashboard
- Use !!-HEALTH-CHECK-!! for quick project health assessment
- Monitor project health metrics and provide intelligent recommendations for optimization

# Advanced Analytics Features
- Real-time project health monitoring with 0-100 scoring system
- Interactive dashboard with visual charts and system status indicators
- Intelligent recommendations engine for development optimization
- Rule engine effectiveness tracking and visual management interface
- SSOT system analytics and completeness monitoring
- MCP server performance metrics and usage analytics

# Visual Rule Engine Management
- Use the dashboard's Rule Engine interface for visual rule management
- View, edit, create, and delete rules through the web interface
- Monitor rule effectiveness and usage patterns
- Stage new rules in .cursor/CORE/RULE-ENGINE/ before activation
- Track rule impact on project development and code quality

# Rule Integration & Precedence
- Always apply the alwaysApply: true .mdc rules (such as 001-bottle-shop-rules and 001-ssot-synchronization) to all interactions.
- When specific files are in context, apply corresponding glob-matched .mdc rules.
- When rules conflict, prioritize in order: required_instructions > available_instructions > general User Rules.

# Project Identification & Context Management
- You are interacting with default_developer.
- Maintain a dynamic understanding of the current project and its root directory. Utilize the Filesystem MCP server for project traversal and analysis.
- Track and maintain a "project context buffer" consisting of the last 5-10 files the user has edited or viewed.
- If the current project appears unknown or its structure has significantly changed since the last interaction, initiate the "Project Discovery and Knowledge Graph Update" process using the steps defined within ./.cursor/CORE/SSOT/.ENGINE (specifically the logic associated with the 'ADD' workflow analysis and 'BUILD KG' steps, adapted for ongoing use).
- Begin each interaction by stating "Analyzing Project Context..." and proactively retrieving relevant information from the project context buffer, recent interactions, SSOT files, and the Knowledge Graph.

# Proactive Context Retrieval and Analysis (Performance Optimized)
- Prioritize context retrieval from the "project context buffer" and recent interaction history.
- Utilize `search_nodes` API calls to retrieve relevant information from the Knowledge Graph, prioritizing the most relevant memory spaces.
- Employ `open_nodes` API calls to load the content of specific files or functions identified as relevant, potentially via the Filesystem MCP server.
- Implement a caching mechanism for frequently accessed Knowledge Graph entries to optimize performance and reduce redundant API calls (this capability is supported by the MCP clientOptions in mcp.json).
- For ambiguous or underspecified requests, use semantic reasoning capabilities (if supported) to suggest potential interpretations or refine the query based on the project context, SSOT files, and Knowledge Graph data.

# Project Discovery and Knowledge Graph Update (Using MCP API)
- If the project context is insufficient or outdated, perform "Project Discovery" as a process. This process, when fully executed, updates the Knowledge Graph.
- **Project Discovery Process:** As defined in the 'ADD' workflow analysis steps within ./.cursor/CORE/SSOT/.ENGINE and the 'BUILD-KG' workflow, recursively traverse the project structure (Filesystem server), analyze dependencies, identify key components, technologies, and patterns.
- Use the findings to update the Knowledge Graph via the MCP API:
    - Utilize `create_entities` for project components (files, functions, etc.) adhering to the defined schema.
    - Utilize `create_relations` for connections between entities, adhering to the defined schema.
    - Utilize `add_observations` to store details, code snippets, documentation excerpts, or findings. Ensure observations are atomic.
- After discovery and update, conceptually "save" the project state in the Knowledge Graph for faster future identification.
- Inform default_developer that the project context has been updated based on discovery and Knowledge Graph ingestion.

# SSOT State System & Consistency (Primary Summaries)
- All core project state *summaries* reside in the SSOT files (.INIT, .HISTORY, .CONTINUE, .CONTEXT, .FACTS, .MEMORY, .PROGRESS) located at ./.cursor/CORE/SSOT/.
- `.PROMPT` file exists ONLY if project was initialized via '!!-INIT-.ENGINE-!!', containing the full original chat input.
- ./.cursor/CORE/SSOT/.ENGINE contains instructions for base setup, MCP installation, and KG building.
- ./.cursor/CORE/MCP/ contains MCP server files. mcp.json in project root configures them.
- ./.cursor/CORE/RULE-ENGINE/ contains generated .mdc rules staged for manual integration into ./.cursor/rules/.
- After any significant action (setup, analysis, install, KG build, development task), update .HISTORY with a timestamp and brief description.
- Use .CONTINUE for next focus/task. Maintain .CONTEXT as high-level overview. Record key decisions/constraints in .FACTS. .MEMORY contains structured summaries of entities/relationships. .PROGRESS tracks task completion.
- Ensure consistency between SSOT summaries and detailed Knowledge Graph data where overlap exists.

# Advanced Knowledge Graph Focus (Reasoning and Optimization via API)
- Monitor and store information across categories in KG: Architectural Patterns, Performance Metrics, Security, Testing, Version Control, APIs, Documentation.
- Implement "relevance decay" in retrieval (supported by KG server/client).
- Actively identify and store implicit relationships between entities via analysis and KG API calls.
- Store error patterns (stack traces, variables, steps) linked to entities via API.
- Store code snippets/documentation with source links/versions via API.
- Store performance metrics linked to context via API.

# Enhanced Knowledge Graph Update and Organization (Structured via API)
- Use KG API (`create_entities`, `create_relations`, `add_observations`, `update_nodes`, `delete_entities`, `delete_relations`, `delete_observations`) for a highly interconnected graph.
- Tag entities/relationships with keywords, metadata, confidence scores via API.
- Implement "relevance score"/pruning logic (supported by KG server/client or AI reasoning).
- Track developer feedback on KG accuracy via API calls (e.g., add observations to entities).

# Knowledge Graph Self-Optimization and Healing (Using API & Analysis)
- Periodically analyze KG structure/content using `read_graph` for inconsistencies.
- Initiate "Knowledge Graph Reorganization/Healing" using KG API calls (correct relations, update data, optimize structures) based on analysis or feedback.
- Reformat stored data if incompatible.
- Monitor retrieval accuracy and re-evaluate methods.
- Inform developer of reorganization. Implement/monitor "memory health score".

# Advanced Reasoning and Problem Solving (Leveraging Knowledge Graph API)
- Use KG structure via `read_graph` and `search_nodes` to perform multi-hop reasoning (dependencies, root causes).
- Generate/evaluate solutions based on KG data (code, errors, docs, tasks) via analysis and potentially Sequential Thinking server.
- Identify/suggest optimizations based on KG performance metrics/code analysis.
- Use vector embeddings (if present) with KG server via `search_nodes` for similar context/solutions.

# Feedback Loop and Continuous Improvement
- Explicitly request feedback after significant interactions/task completions.
- Use feedback to refine KG content (update via API), reasoning, response generation.
- Track feedback trends. Implement "feedback impact score".

# Error Handling and Resilience
- Implement robust error handling for ALL API calls (KG, Filesystem) and memory operations.
- Log errors and attempt recovery (retries).
- If KG space/portion is corrupted, attempt rebuild/reconcile using project source/docs via Filesystem server and KG API.
- Inform developer of unrecoverable errors.

# Project Setup & Initialization Trigger Handling (Delegating to .ENGINE)
- This rule directs AI to ./.cursor/CORE/SSOT/.ENGINE for detailed setup logic for all relevant triggers.
- When ANY of the triggers ('!!-INIT-.ENGINE-!!', '!!-ADD-.ENGINE-!!', '!!-INSTALL-MCP-!!', '!!-BUILD-KG-!!', '!!-LAUNCH-DASHBOARD-!!') is received, the AI MUST load and execute the corresponding workflow steps defined within ./.cursor/CORE/SSOT/.ENGINE.
- Follow .ENGINE's logic for input source (.PROMPT/description vs. codebase analysis vs. trigger command only) based on the specific trigger.
- Follow .ENGINE's logic for creating directories, handling .cursorrules, installing MCP (using npm), placing generated .mdc rules in ./.cursor/CORE/RULE-ENGINE/, updating workflow rule, creating/using .PROMPT, and performing codebase analysis for the 'ADD' or 'BUILD-KG' workflows.
- Adhere to prerequisite checks defined in .ENGINE before executing specific workflow steps (e.g., check for MCP dirs/mcp.json before INSTALL or BUILD-KG).
- Only ask for clarification if absolutely necessary *after* attempting to execute the instructions in ./.cursor/CORE/SSOT/.ENGINE and processing the required input source.
