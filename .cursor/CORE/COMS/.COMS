# Cursor AI Agent Commands (Copy & Paste)
#
# Use these commands in the Cursor AI chat to trigger specific workflows.
# Detailed instructions for these commands are in ./ .cursor/CORE/COMS/.COMS-ENGINE
# and the primary execution logic is in ./ .cursor/CORE/SSOT/.ENGINE.
#

## --- System Setup Commands ---

!!-INIT-.ENGINE-!!
# Usage: Initialize system in a NEW project. Provide detailed project description BEFORE this command in chat.
#
# Example:
# This project is a simple Node.js web server using Express. It will have endpoints for users and products.
# It should connect to a PostgreSQL database. Use TypeScript.
# !!-INIT-.ENGINE-!!
#

!!-ADD-.ENGINE-!!
# Usage: Integrate system into an EXISTING project. Use by itself in chat. AI will analyze codebase.
#
# Example:
# !!-ADD-.ENGINE-!!
#

!!-INSTALL-MCP-!!
# Usage: Install MCP servers (Knowledge Graph, etc.). Run AFTER !!-INIT-.ENGINE-!! or !!-ADD-.ENGINE-!!
# Make sure ./ .cursor/mcp.json exists and is configured (especially backup paths) BEFORE running this.
# Requires internet access for npm install.
#
# Example:
# !!-INSTALL-MCP-!!
#

!!-BUILD-KG-!!
# Usage: Build the initial Knowledge Graph from the project codebase analysis. Run AFTER !!-INSTALL-MCP-!!
# and ensuring MCP servers are running/Cursor is restarted.
#
# Example:
# !!-BUILD-KG-!!
#

## --- State & Context Commands ---

!!-LOAD-PORTABLE-!!
# Usage: Load project state, SSOT files, and potentially populate KG from ./ .cursor/CORE/SSOT/.PORTABLE
# Make sure the .PORTABLE file exists and the format is correct BEFORE running.
#
# Example:
# !!-LOAD-PORTABLE-!!
#

!!-UPDATE-SSOT-!!
# Usage: Synthesize and update SSOT files (.HISTORY, .FACTS, .MEMORY, etc.) based on recent changes/activity.
# Use after completing a task or set of changes.
#
# Example:
# !!-UPDATE-SSOT-!!
#

!!-CREATE-PORTABLE-!!
# Usage: Create/update ./ .cursor/CORE/SSOT/.PORTABLE with a snapshot of current project state (SSOT, rules, analysis, KG).
# Use to save state or prepare for transfer.
#
# Example:
# !!-CREATE-PORTABLE-!!
#

!!-CREATE-CHAT-HISTORY-!!
# Usage: Copy the current chat history into ./ .cursor/CORE/SSOT/.CHAT.
#
# Example:
# !!-CREATE-CHAT-HISTORY-!!
#

## --- Maintenance & Documentation Commands ---

!!-UPDATE-DOCS-!!
# Usage: Analyze project state and update documentation, including README.md and code comments.
#
# Example:
# !!-UPDATE-DOCS-!!
#

!!-PREPARE-GITHUB-!!
# Usage: Analyze project for GitHub readiness - update .gitignore, check for sensitive data, check docs.
#
# Example:
# !!-PREPARE-GITHUB-!!
