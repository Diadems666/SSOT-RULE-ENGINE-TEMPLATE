**SSOT-RULE-ENGINE-TEMPLATE Project Initialization**

**Project Type:** Advanced AI Development Framework Template (Gold-Standard Template)
**Analysis Source:** Comprehensive codebase analysis via !!-ADD-.ENGINE-!!
**Initialization Date:** 2025-01-27
**Project Status:** Fully verified, distributable template

**Core Purpose:**
Intelligent AI-powered development framework that combines Single Source of Truth (SSOT) project state management, context-aware Rule Engine, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration to create a self-organizing, learning development environment. Now distributed as a ready-to-deploy template for rapid adoption in new/existing projects.

**Key Features Identified:**
- 🧠 Persistent AI Memory via Knowledge Graph
- 📋 Centralized SSOT State Management
- 🎛️ Context-Aware AI Behavior through Rule Engine
- 🔧 Advanced AI Capabilities via MCP servers
- 📊 Intelligent Project Tracking and Analytics
- 📈 Real-time Project Health Monitoring
- 🚀 Complete deployment automation (DEPLOY folder)
- 📝 Manifest and verification checklist for quality assurance

**Technical Architecture:**
- Python-based analytics and dashboard system
- Node.js MCP server implementations
- JSON/JSONL configuration and storage
- Markdown-based documentation and rules
- Web-based interactive dashboard
- Deployment scripts: deploy.ps1 (Windows), deploy.sh (Unix/Linux/macOS)
- Manifest: TEMPLATE_MANIFEST.md
- Verification: DEPLOYMENT_VERIFICATION.md

**Current Project State:**
- Analytics system implemented and functional
- MCP servers configured, ready for npm install
- Rule engine foundation established
- Dashboard system ready for deployment
- Template structure complete, cleaned, and documented
- .INIT.template and verification checklist included for new deployments

**Integration Method:** ADD workflow (existing codebase analysis)
**Next Steps:** Install MCP servers, build Knowledge Graph, launch analytics dashboard, deploy to new projects using DEPLOY template
