**SSOT-RULE-ENGINE-TEMPLATE Next Steps**

**Immediate Priority: MCP Server Installation**

**Current Status:**
- ✅ SSOT system integration complete
- ✅ Project analysis and state population finished
- ✅ Analytics system ready for deployment
- ⏳ MCP servers configured but not installed
- ⏳ Knowledge Graph empty and waiting for build
- ⏳ Dashboard system ready but not launched

**Next Action Required:**
```
!!-INSTALL-MCP-!!
```

**Installation Sequence:**
1. **MCP Server Installation** (immediate next step)
   - Install knowledge-graph server dependencies
   - Install sequential-thinking server dependencies  
   - Install filesystem server dependencies
   - Verify all npm installations successful
   - Confirm server readiness status

2. **Knowledge Graph Building** (after MCP install)
   - Execute `!!-BUILD-KG-!!` trigger
   - Perform entity and relationship extraction
   - Build comprehensive project graph
   - Validate graph structure and content

3. **Dashboard Launch** (automatic after ADD completion)
   - System will auto-execute `!!-LAUNCH-DASHBOARD-!!`
   - Launch analytics dashboard on localhost
   - Verify dashboard accessibility
   - Confirm all features operational

**Expected Outcomes:**
- MCP servers fully operational (3/3 ready)
- Knowledge Graph populated with project entities
- Analytics dashboard accessible via web interface
- System health score improved to 80+/100
- Full SSOT-RULE-ENGINE-TEMPLATE functionality achieved

**Success Criteria:**
- All MCP servers respond to health checks
- Knowledge Graph contains project structure
- Dashboard shows comprehensive analytics
- Rule engine management interface functional
- USER-RULES template system operational

**Potential Issues to Monitor:**
- npm installation permissions or dependencies
- Port conflicts for MCP servers
- Memory allocation for Knowledge Graph
- Browser compatibility for dashboard
- File system permissions for logs and data

**Post-Installation Tasks:**
- Run comprehensive project analysis
- Validate system health metrics
- Test rule engine effectiveness
- Verify Knowledge Graph accuracy
- Document any configuration adjustments needed
