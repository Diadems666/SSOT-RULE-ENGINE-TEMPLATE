## üìä Understanding Your Analytics

### Health Score Breakdown

The overall health score (0-100) is calculated from four key components:

1. **SSOT System Health (30%)**
   - File completeness: Are all required SSOT files present?
   - Consistency score: How well-synchronized are your state files?
   - Content quality: Meaningful data vs. placeholder content

2. **MCP Server Health (30%)**
   - Server readiness: Are MCP servers properly configured and compiled?
   - Memory efficiency: Optimal resource usage patterns
   - Integration completeness: Full MCP ecosystem activation

3. **Rule Engine Health (25%)**
   - Coverage percentage: How well does your rule set cover project needs?
   - Effectiveness score: Are rules producing intended behavior changes?
   - Optimization opportunities: Unused or conflicting rules

4. **General Project Health (15%)**
   - Recent activity levels
   - Development velocity trends
   - File organization and structure

### Health Score Interpretation

| Score Range | Status | Meaning |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| 80-100 | üéâ Excellent | System is optimally configured and performing well |
| 60-79 | üëç Good | System is functional with minor optimization opportunities |
| 40-59 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Attention | Several issues require addressing for optimal performance |
| 0-39 | üö® Critical | Significant problems require immediate attention |

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Custom Analytics Queries

The analytics engine can be extended with custom queries:

```python
from analytics_engine import SSOTAnalyticsEngine

# Initialize engine
engine = SSOTAnalyticsEngine()

# Generate full report
metrics = engine.generate_comprehensive_report()

# Access specific metrics
print(f"Project health: {metrics.ssot_health_score}")
print(f"Rule effectiveness: {metrics.health_indicators['rules']['effectiveness']}")
```

### Dashboard Customization

The dashboard can be customized by modifying:
- `dashboard.py`: Core dashboard logic
- `styles.css`: Visual appearance and theming
- Chart configurations: Data visualization preferences

### Integration with CI/CD

  run: |
    cd .cursor/CORE/ANALYTICS
    python analytics_engine.py
    # Fail build if health score below threshold
```
